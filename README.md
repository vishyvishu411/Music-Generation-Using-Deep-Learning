# Music-Generation-Using-Deep-Learning
This project aimed to develop an AI-driven music ​generation system designed specifically for
creating short audio clips. The system utilized advance AI technologies, including Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Auto-Encoders, and Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs), to generate short audio clips tailored to specified instrument.

The project leveraged 4-second instrument-specific audio clips from Google’s NSynth dataset as
input to the generator, ensuring the production of high-quality, instrument-specific audio content
for various short-form media applications.
